# QMD Collections Configuration
# Location: ~/.config/qmd/index.yml
#
# This file defines all collections and their contexts.
# You can manually edit this file - changes take effect immediately.

# Global context applied to all collections
# Use this for universal search instructions or patterns
global_context: "If you see a relevant [[WikiWord]], you can search for that WikiWord to get more context."

# Optional API model overrides (per capability).
# If a capability is fully configured here (base_url + key + model),
# QMD will call that API instead of the built-in local GGUF model.
# If not configured, QMD keeps using local models.
